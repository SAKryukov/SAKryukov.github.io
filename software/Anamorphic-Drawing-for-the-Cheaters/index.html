<h2 id="heading.introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h2 id="heading.illusion-effect">Illusion Effect</h2>
<p><em>Anamorphic Drawing</em> application helps to produce one of the anamorphic illusions: a piece of paper with a printed image which, if viewed from a specially selected <em>vantage point</em>, shows an image of rectangular piece of paper shown in <em>perspective</em> and some objects placed on top of near it, distorted to compensate the perspective projection. As a result, it produces the result of a “3D” image “sticking out” of the piece paper on which it is seemingly drawn.</p>
<p>If some real object is placed on top of paper, so part of its background represents the image of a piece of paper and part of it is the image of the other object, it produces the effect of “impossible picture” in the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher">Maurits Escher</a>.</p>
<p>Presently, one can find many intricate images <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=anamorphic+illusion">demonstrated by authors on youtube</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading.the-trick">The Trick</h2>
<p>This piece of paper should be shown symmetrically in the picture, as a trapezoidal This piece of paper should be shown symmetrically in the picture, as a trapezoidal <span><img src="photograph.png" alt="[photograph]"/></span> shape.<br/></p>

<h2 id="heading.workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>Photograph the object on some piece of paper. Make sure that the from edge of paper is parallel to the lower boundary of the frame and looks symmetric. This requirement is approximate. Use a tripod. When the picture is taken, don’t move the tripod and mark the location of the piece of paper! You will need the same locations when you photograph the result.</p>
<p>Photograph the object on some piece of paper. Make sure that the from edge of paper is parallel to the lower boundary of the frame and looks symmetric. This requirement is approximate. Use a tripod. When the picture is taken, don’t move the tripod and mark the location of the piece of paper! You will need the same locations when you photograph the result.</p>
<p>Make sure your picture aspect ratio is the same as of the piece of paper photographed. If needed, crop the picture to required aspect ratio using any suitable image editor.</p>
<p id="image.step1">Load your source picture by AnamorphicDrawing.exe:</p>
<p><img src="step1.png" alt="Load" /></p>
<p id="image.step2">Mark four corners of the image of the paper by placing appropriate corner grip. You can quickly start by clicking on each corner clockwise, starting from the top-left one. Don't worry about accuracy: you can fix it later:</p>
<p><img src="step2.png" alt="Mark corners" /></p>
<p id="image.step3">Using Tab key or mouse, activate each of the corner grip and adjust their location accurately, using arrow keys. Course move: Alt+Ctrl+Shift keys, finer move: 2 of the prefix keys, even finer move: one prefix key, 1-pixel move: no prefix keys:</p>
<p><img src="step3.png" alt="Adjust corners" /></p>
<p id="image.step4">Hit "Next" to obtain anamorphic image. Piece of paper is transformed to appear as a rectangular with the same aspect ratio as the source image:</p>
<p><img src="step4.png" alt="Transform" /></p>
<p id="image.step5">Move crop grips to define crop:</p>
<p><img src="step5.png" alt="Define crop" /></p>
<p id="image.step6">Crop is defined, matching the edges of the piece of paper. On this image, one can see that transformed image is not strictly rectangular. This is some distortion of the method. Hit "Next":</p>
<p><img src="step6.png" alt="Crop" /></p>
<p id="image.step6">Now anamorphic image is cropped and scaled. You can save it and print out:</p>
<p><img src="step7.png" alt="Save and print" /></p>
<p>The image should be scaled for printing, to approximately match the size of original piece of paper which was photographed. This rule is approximate. Anamorphic image has is considerably taller than this piece of paper.<br />
For good results, it’s better to use moderate perspective, otherwise anamorphic image is too tall, which, in turn, leads to high distortions.</p>
<p>Printed image can be used as it is. Alternatively, the same image can be processed to obtain contours of the image, which can be made very pale, to serve as a convenient pad for manual drawing. First image, full-colored one, can be uses as a sample.</p>
<p>The picture on paper is prepared. Then it needs to be cut out to remove background areas. On the pictures shown above, this is the brown-colored area.</p>
<p>The anamorphic image can now be photographed. Assuming the tripod is still in the same position, and the zoom level of the lense is the same as in first place, we can place resulting print using the same position and orientation as original image.</p>
<h2 id="heading.user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>The transform and cropping are defined by aspect ratio of the image and the user selection using <em>grips</em>. Each grip can be selected, one at a time. The description of a currently selected grip is shown in the status bar. Grips can be selected be a mouse click or using the Tab key, Shift Tab for in-reverse motion.<br />
When a grip is selected, it can be moved by the arrow keys.</p>
<p>Grip motion keyboard assignments can be easily remembered: Shift and Control has the same weight, and Alt has double weight; and combination of 2 or 3 keys increases step, depending on the keys weights.</p>
<h4 id="heading.corner-grips">Corner Grips</h4>
<p>Four corner grips are named “Top Left”, “Top Right”, “Bottom Right” and “Bottom Left” are visited using the Tab key in this order. For example, see the <a href="#image.step2">picture shown above</a>.</p>
<p>A grip changes its appearance depending on its state:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><img src="Grip-selected.png" alt="[selected focused grip]"/></span> selected</li>
<li><span><img src="Grip-unselected.png" alt="[unselected grip]"/></span> unselected</li>
<li><span><img src="Grip-selected-mouseOver.png" alt="[selected grip with mouse over]"/></span> selected with mouse pointer over</li>
<li><span><img src="Grip-mouseOver.png" alt="[grip with mouse over]"/></span> unselected with mouse pointer over</li>
</ul>
<p>Keyboard Assignments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrow keys: fine grip movement, 1-pixel step</li>
<li>Arrow keys + Shift or Arrow keys + Ctrl: 5-pixel step</li>
<li>Arrow keys + Alt: 10-pixel step</li>
<li>Arrow keys + Ctrl+Alt or Arrow keys + Ctrl+Alt: 20-pixel step</li>
<li>Arrow keys + Ctrl+Shift+Alt: 100-pixel step</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="heading.crop-grips">Crop Grips</h4>
<p>Four crop grips, “Left”, “Top”, “Right” and “Bottom” (visited using the Tab key in this order) combine color changes depending on the state: if a grip is selected, its color becomes lighter; if mouse is over, the color tone becomes warmer. For example, see the <a href="#image.step5">picture shown above</a>.</p>
<p>Keyboard Assignments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrow keys: fine grip movement, 1-pixel step</li>
<li>Arrow keys + Shift or Arrow keys + Ctrl: 5-pixel step</li>
<li>Arrow keys + Alt: 10-pixel step</li>
<li>Arrow keys + Ctrl+Alt or Arrow keys + Ctrl+Alt: 50-pixel step</li>
<li>Arrow keys + Ctrl+Shift+Alt: 250-pixel step</li>
</ol>
